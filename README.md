### Welcome

I'm Oran, a Java engineer working at [@Adyen](https://adyen.com) on the development and testing tools team. I'm working on maintaining and extending the CI pipeline, and also providing tools for Adyen developers to increase their workflow efficiency.

Prior to Adyen, I worked at SAP on the SAP Data Intelligence product as a security developer. I worked on security relevant microservices and also mitigated cloud security risks on AWS and Azure.

In the past I've learned and worked on:
